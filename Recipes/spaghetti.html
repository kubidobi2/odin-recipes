    <h1>Spaghetti</h1>

    <h2>What is Spaghetti</h2>
    <p> Spaghetti is the quintessential Italian pasta. It is long – like a string (hence the name, as spago means string) – round in cross-section and made from durum wheat semolina. 
        Commercial varieties are generally used, but artisanal versions are easy to find. This is the best known pasta shape in the world, so much so that the name is identical in nearly every language.</p>
    <h2>Italian tradition</h2>
    <p> Originally, spaghetti was served like any other kind of pasta, with only olive oil and cheese. Only at the beginning of the 18th century did spaghetti begin to be served with tomato sauce. 
        Today, spaghetti may be served with meat sauce, seafood, vegetables, cheeses or sausages. This is an extremely versatile dish, as often a good tomato sauce, a dusting of lemon zest and a few fresh basil leaves will make a truly memorable first course. </p>
